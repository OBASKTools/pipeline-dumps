# OBASK Data Dump Pipeline

Knowledge Graph exporting pipeline for the Ontology Based Application Starter Kit

The dumps pipeline access the triple store to obtain the data dumps. Then it transforms and enriches for ingestion to production services, such as solr and knowledge graph (neo4j).

WARNING:_OBASK tools originated with work carried out to support the [Virtual Fly Brain](virtualflybrain.org) project, the [Allen Cell-Type Knowledge Explorer](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/celltypes) and the [Cell Annotation Platform](celltype.info). Work to split this out into OBASK tools is currently ongoing and so code on this repo should be considered Alpha and may be subject to breaking changes._
